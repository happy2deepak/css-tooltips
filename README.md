# css-tooltips
A purely CSS3 powered Tooltip library compatible with all modern browsers. CSS-Tooltips use HTML5's data-attrib to collect text which has to be shown inside the Tooltip when a user hovers over the text.

Add the `css-tooltips.css` in your project folder and use it. For examples or Demo, checkout the `index.html` file
